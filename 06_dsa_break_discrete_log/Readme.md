## Overview
This project implements the **Baby-Step Giant-Step algorithm** to solve the **discrete logarithm problem** and a basic **Digital Signature Scheme (DSA)** using Python. It demonstrates how to:
1. Solve the discrete logarithm problem to find a private signing key.
2. Use the private key to sign a document using the DSA.
   
The solution works with given parameters for **Samantha’s DSA** public key and signs a document with a provided hash.

   - Functions to compute the extended GCD and modular inverse, essential for cryptographic calculations.

### 2. **Baby-Step Giant-Step Algorithm**
   - An efficient algorithm that computes the discrete logarithm in `g^x ≡ A (mod p)`.

### 3. **Digital Signature Scheme**
   - A simplified signing process where the document hash `D` is signed using the private key `x`, and the signature is computed using a random element `k`.

## Example Usage
The code takes parameters such as Samantha’s public key, the prime modulus `p`, generator `g`, and the document hash `D`. It:
1. Solves for the private key `x`.
2. Signs the document with the private key and a random `k`.
