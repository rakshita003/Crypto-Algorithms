## In-Depth Exploration of Cryptographic Concepts

Each implementation not only demonstrates a working algorithm but also aims to provide practical insights into the theory and application of cryptography. The focus is on understanding the mathematical underpinnings and cryptographic principles behind each algorithm, as well as showcasing potential security flaws and how they can be mitigated.

For example, the repository delves into:
- **Primality testing** with Miller-Rabin, a widely used probabilistic test in cryptographic key generation.
- **RSA optimizations** using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which significantly improves performance for large integers in RSA encryption and decryption.
- **Key exchange mechanisms** comparing the performance and security between classic Diffie-Hellman and modern Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).
- **Digital signature security** and attacks, such as demonstrating how poor randomness in DSA key generation can lead to severe vulnerabilities.
